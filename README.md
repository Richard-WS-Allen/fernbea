# fernbea Chess Engine

This project is to attempt to build a ML chess engine as a capstone project for
an AI and ML bootcamp. Although I'm more comfortable using C++, we're using
python for the bootcamp. I intend to use bitboards and masks in implementing
move generation. I also intend to parse chess games in PGN, to cluster
positions from my chess games where I frequently make mistakes or miss gained
advantages and use this to generate puzzles that are catered to my play.
